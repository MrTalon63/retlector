# ReTLEctor

### What is ReTLEctor?

Very simple web app to cache and return TLEs from Celestrak, so you can avoid getting blocked by their servers when you need to get TLEs for a large number of satellites (Or you test shit).

### Features

- Customizable ratelimiting and caching duration with environment variables
- Dockerized for easy deployment
- Light on resources

### Hosted version

ReTLEctor is hosted by me at [retlector.eu](https://retlector.eu) free of charge. While I can't guarantee uptime I will try my best to keep it running as long as I can.

### Selfhosting

As the application is Dockerized, you can easily run it on your own server or local machine using Docker.
Example docker compose file is available [here](https://github.com/MrTalon63/retlector/blob/master/docker-compose.yml).
