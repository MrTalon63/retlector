			<h1>Welcome to ReTLEctor</h1>
			<p>
				This is a simple web app to cache and return TLEs from Celestrak, so you can avoid getting blocked by their servers when you need to get TLEs for a large number of satellites (Or you testing shit).
				<br />
			</p>

			<br />

			<h3>Table below represents the cached TLEs and their URIs as well as last update time:</h3>

			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>TLE</th>
					<th>URI</th>
					<th>Last Update</th>
				</tr>
				{activeGroups.map((group) => (
					<tr>
						<td>{group.name}</td>
						<td>/tle/{group.name}</td>
						<td>{group.lastUpdate}</td>
					</tr>
				))}
			</table>

			<p>Support for custom NORAD IDs will be added soon-ish.</p>
			<p>Data is updated every ~{cacheDuration / 1000 / 60} minutes.</p>
			<p>
				Current rate limit is {maxReq} requests per {maxReqWindow / 1000} seconds. That might change in the future, pay attention to the headers returned by the server.
			</p>
